# Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM and MFCC

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features extracted from the RAVDESS dataset.

## Dataset

The [RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976) dataset consists of 1440 audio files, each lasting approximately 3-5 seconds, with 24 actors expressing various emotions.

## Features

- MFCCs are extracted from audio signals to capture the timbral aspects of speech.

## Model

An LSTM-based neural network is trained to classify emotions from the extracted MFCC features.

## Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place the RAVDESS dataset in the data/ directory.

Run the preprocessing script:
